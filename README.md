# Elamicon

We are cataloging [Linear Elam](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/elam-iv) glyphs and try to group them into letters. You can visit the [Elamicon catalog page](https://sbalmer.github.io/elamicon) to see the glyphs we've added so far.


## Our goals

- Catalog all glyphs found in Linear Elamite fragments
- Create a digital font from the glyphs
- Transcribe all known fragments of Linear Elamite into a text corpus
- Offer basic tools that help in analyzing the corpus


## Legalese

The corpus, font source, and all program code will be available under a permissive license (sorry we haven't settled on the exact text yet). If you claim copyright to text or glyph shapes on any of the fragments, please point this out to us and we will gladly remove all traces of the forgery.

Compiled fonts are derivatives of the [Liberation Fonts](https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/). They are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
